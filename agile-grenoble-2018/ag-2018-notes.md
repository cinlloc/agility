# Agile Grenoble 2018

A little return about Agile Grenoble 2018, for those interested. Sorry for spamming the one who are not, feel free to burn this mail.  

It was my second edition, and found it great, even if a little bit disappointed by some workshops. It's a good place to exchange about agility practices, get a wider view about what agile approach can bring at the individual, team and company levels.

All slides and details are available on https://agilegrenoble2018.sched.com/

# 💎 Intelligence émotionnelle, comment développer son agilité ?

How emotions and feelings plays a major role in our work interactions, how can we improve them.
How can we analyze them and put in place some emotional strategies to: limit the ones that are unpleasant, use them into a positive way.
It seems quite obscure at first but was very interesting and concrete, did a workshop about it and was really surprising.

# 💎 Release is coming ! Saurez-vous combattre le Lego©cy code et vous asseoir sur le trône de fer ?

A very good lego kata about legacy code in three parts, around Game Of Throne universe. I'll be happy to try it in USS ;-)

# 💎 Appreciative inquiry

An approach that takes "problem solving" reversely by asking organization: what works well? Really interesting to go beyond problems.

# 😞 Retrospectez vous ! Rien ne vaut la pratique !

Went to this to get returns of experience around retro, new ideas and discuss facilitation technics.
Unfortunately, it was a real disappointment, as we were stuck in situation of participants, not facilitators, and time was too really short, even to do retrospective correctly.
So we didn't discuss at all about good and bad practices in retrospectives, facilitation technics...

# 😄 Politique, politique, politique - Gérer vos relations professionnelles au travail

Really funny and sharped about politics in business. Playing a lot with paradoxes (politic is about how to link paradoxes). It can help to take some distance when facing problematic situations in work. Examples of the 12 rules:

2. It’s better to be effective than right
3. It’s better to be right
6. It ain’t personal... it’s business
7. It’s ALWAYS personal

# 😄 Intégrer l'ergonomie en milieu agile : plus compliqué qu'il n'y parait

A really interesting one, pointing out that agile and ergonomy have some contradictions to handle. First one: agility is focused on making the customer happy, ergonomy is for making the user happy. Second one: UX needs a global vision to keep consistent, and agility is about small increments. Presenter exposed several concrete ways she tried to deal with that.

# 😄 Le Fabuleux Destin de Tim Member

This was about agility and philosophy. A great reflexion and a great show!

# 😐 Mince, il n'y a plus de post-it ! Saurez vous relever le challenge ?

As a team of 4 people, we prepare a retro together without any post-its. Idea was great, but time too short. It learned me that several persons can prepare a decent retro together in 40 minutes.

# 😄 Comment l’agilité m’a permis de terminer l’une des courses les plus dures du monde

Return of experience about how Scrum has been used to prepare the TOR Ultra-Trail (330 km and 30.000 m D+). It shows concretely how agility works in other field than programming, for complex and unpredictable projects, at individual level. The only limit I found is: can we really talk about Scrum for individual project?
